# P8


This Repo contains ongoing work to develop a generic Espruino Module to support basic functions from the P8 Smart Watch.

The content of this repo is in development, and may change at any time. Be Warned.

My Starting Point
==============
The essence of this module is created bij @fanoush and extended by @Enaon.
Special thanks to them for heir excellent work.

My Additions
=============
My additions follow the Espruino Bangle syntax when possible, that saves me from making some documentation ;-)
Ref : https://www.espruino.com/Reference#Bangle
Special thanks to @gordon for sharing Espruino to the world and supporting it in a terrif way, kodos!

Install the Espruino Module
- Use the Espruino WebIde to upload the "P8Espruino...." file to "Flash (Allways)"

Load a example Espruino programm
- Use the Espruino WebIde to the "Test....." file to RAM

The example
- The P8 screen shows some graphics for a few secs and then switches off.
- Pressing the P8 button toggles the screen On and OFF
- Espruino monitor shows some debug information

ISSUES
======
I develop for my own fun, so I lack the time to give a lot of support in using this code.

But if you find a bug in the module, open an "Issue", because probably it's a bug for me too ;-)
